Game simulation \
Petya and Masha were playing tag. Petya decided to cheat: while Masha wasnâ€™t looking, he pulled out the panels with numbers and rearranged them (perhaps in the correct order). Help Masha and write a program that will determine whether it is possible to obtain the correct sequence during a fair game (without removing the panels).

Input: two-dimensional array of numbers, where None is an empty cell
Output: True/False

Solve for the board:
a) 2x2
b) 3x3
c) 4x4
